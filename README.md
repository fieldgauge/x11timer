# x11timer
Very basic alarm clock for minimal Linux Desktop Environments.

Created years ago when I missed [KTeaTime](https://www.kde.org/applications/games/kteatime) after switching from KDE to OpenBox.

## Installation
Copy the `alarm` script to a directory in your path, e.g. `~/bin` . 
Make sure it is executable by running `chmod +x /path/to/alarm` .

## Usage
### Example: 3min timer
```alarm 3 Teatime```
